&lt;p>As someone who crunches out code, whether moderately or a lot if you’re like me. You must have incurred some technical debt somewhere along the lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="development-approaches">Development approaches&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Technical debt is the term given to a certain programming scenario. Assume you had a project with a target deadline. As the technical lead of the project, you are sometimes faced with two decisions which are:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-long-and-proper-way">The long and proper way&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Using this approach is the most ideal way of development. Many best practises of development are followed using this way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Staying Sane among all the craziness (keeping up with technology)</title><link>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/staying-sane-craziness-keeping-technology/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2013 09:07:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/staying-sane-craziness-keeping-technology/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-wisemans-advice">A wiseman’s advice&lt;/h2>

You see, my thought as a young, gadget addicted teenager was that. “This was some excuse he’d come up with just to have some breathing space from getting me the latest video games”. How naive I was though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How learning a new programming language can help you become a better programmer?</title><link>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/learning-programming-language-programmer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2013 09:20:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/learning-programming-language-programmer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="my-theory">My Theory&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I came into first year at the University of Manchester, with a fair knowledge of programming in Java. I was fully aware that there were people out there who were well versed in other languages and using it to solve real life problems. Even with this knowledge, I did not even bother to look into any other because I hadn’t yet known the importance of learning a new programming language. I was under the impression that Java was all I needed to know. That if I knew it well enough, it could easily solve any problem I wanted to.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
