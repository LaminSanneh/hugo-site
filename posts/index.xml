This will include configuring Webpack to handle TypeScript and React code, setting up a development server, and building our project for production.
Prerequisites Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Basic understanding of React.js, TypeScript, and Webpack. Project Setup First, let&amp;rsquo;s create a new directory for our project and initialize a new Node.js project.</description></item><item><title>Playwright and React.js Typescript Todo App Automated End to End Testing with Vite</title><link>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/playwright-react-js-typescript-todo-app-automated-testing-vite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 20:22:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/playwright-react-js-typescript-todo-app-automated-testing-vite/</guid><description>Introduction In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll create a simple Todo app using React.js and TypeScript, initialized with Vite, and then we&amp;rsquo;ll write tests for it using Playwright. We will use playwright to do an end to end test which will simulate the user browser interaction with our todo app like adding new todos, deleting todos, upadtinhg todos e.t.c. By the end of this guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a solid understanding of how to use Playwright to test your React applications.</description></item><item><title>React.js Typescript Todo App Testing with Jest and React Testing Library and Vite</title><link>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/react-js-typescript-todo-app-testing-jest-react-testing-library-vite/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 14:24:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/react-js-typescript-todo-app-testing-jest-react-testing-library-vite/</guid><description>Introduction In this tutorial, we shall setup Jest and React Testing Library to perform integration test. We will be testing React.Js components, so this will not be an end to test, but we will be testing the individual coponents involved in the Todo App. At each stage, we will render the components invovled using the library functions provided by React Testing Library. We shall pass in properties to each component and test their behavious and visualisation by simulating clicks and text typing into textboxes using the appropriate functions.</description></item><item><title>How to Dockerize a Laravel 11 and React 18 Application for Development</title><link>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/dockerize-laravel-11-react-18-application-development/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 13:03:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/dockerize-laravel-11-react-18-application-development/</guid><description>Introduction Docker has become a popular choice for development environments due to its ability to containerize applications and simplify deployment across different systems. This guide will walk you through dockerizing a Laravel 11 backend and React 18 frontend application, using Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple services. We wil assume that your laravel and react apps live in seperate folders and will be served through different domain. Suffice to say that the react app will not be served from the laravel backend but will use the laravel backend only as an api service.</description></item><item><title>React.js How to use User Roles to Secure Frontend Menu Links and Routes Using a Wrapper Component for User Authentication and Backend Permission Control</title><link>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/react-js-user-roles-secure-frontend-menu-links-routes-wrapper-component-user-authentication-backend-permission-control/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 12:35:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/react-js-user-roles-secure-frontend-menu-links-routes-wrapper-component-user-authentication-backend-permission-control/</guid><description>In modern web applications, managing user authentication and permissions is crucial. One effective way to handle this in React.js is by using a wrapper component. This article will guide you through creating a wrapper component that controls access to routes and links based on user roles and permissions. We will leverage Redux Toolkit to manage user state and permissions.

This ensures that when a component re-renders or unmounts, for several reasons like a user clicks on another link related to the same component, it does not attempt to set state based on outdated or irrelevant asynchronous responses.</description></item><item><title>Cypress and TypeScript React.js Todo App End-to-End Testing</title><link>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/cypress-typescript-react-js-todo-app-testing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 09:42:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://laminsanneh.com/posts/cypress-typescript-react-js-todo-app-testing/</guid><description>Introduction In this tutorial, we will build a React.js Todo app using TypeScript, initialize the project using Vite, and set up Cypress for end-to-end (E2E) testing.
