## Manual all the way!

When you start out web developing, the appeal to do a lot of stuff manually might be appealing. However, once you step into intermediate to advanced level you will probably be constantly searching for tools to help automate your workflow. One such tool for me is Live Reload.

If you are wondering what this tool does. It enables you to see html changes instantly in your browser as you type. All this happens withou you needing to refresh your browser on every change to your markup. The reload is done by the tool automatically

You can probably set it up for use in various ways. One easy way I found very quick to set up is to use the chrome extension in conjunction with sublime text 2 plugin.
