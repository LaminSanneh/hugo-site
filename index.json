In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk through a complete example of how to implement such a system, focusing on updating the state based on user interactions and fetching initial data from an external source. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into the code and explore each part of the implementation.\nComponent Overview The component we\u0026rsquo;ll be discussing is MyUserRolesComponent, which allows users to select multiple roles via checkboxes. The component initializes with all checkboxes unchecked and updates its state as users interact with it. Additionally, it fetches existing role data for a user from a server and updates the checkboxes accordingly.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the full component code for reference:\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; function MyUserRolesComponent () { // By default all checkbox values are set to false const selectedRoleValues = { 1: false, 2: false, 3: false }; // component state for holding the selected roles in the dom const [selectedRoles, setSelectedRoles] = useState\u0026lt;{[index: number]: boolean}\u0026gt;(selectedRoleValues); // handler which updates the state selectedRoles whenever a user checks or unchecks a role const onSelectedRoleChange = (roleId: number) =\u0026gt; { setSelectedRoles({...selectedRoles, ...{[roleId]: !selectedRoles[roleId]}}); } useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { let ignoreFetchedUserData = false; if (!route.id) { return; } dispatch(fetchUser(Number.parseInt(route.id, 10))) .unwrap() .then((response) =\u0026gt; { if (ignoreFetchedUserData) { // this is the result of the server call using some reducer action which returns the user roles from some server // for now, we abstract the function call const roles: {[index: number]: boolean}[] = response.roles; const selectedRolesFromServer = Object.assign({}, ...roles.map(role =\u0026gt; ({ [role.id]: true }))); // here we update the selectedRoles state by overriding it with some values from the server setSelectedRoles({...selectedRoles, ...selectedRolesFromServer}); } }) .catch(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Error fetching user\u0026#34;); }); return () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Clearing Use effect\u0026#34;); ignoreFetchedUserData = true; }; }, [route, dispatch]); return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; { availableRoles.map((role) =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;label key={role.id}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;checkbox\u0026#34; checked={selectedRoles[role.id]} onChange={() =\u0026gt; { onSelectedRoleChange(role.id); }} /\u0026gt;{\u0026#34; \u0026#34;} {role.name} \u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; ); }) } \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } export default MyUserRolesComponent; Lets now dive deeper and explain each part:\nState Initialization We start by initializing the state for the checkboxes. Each checkbox corresponds to a user role, identified by a unique ID. Initially, all checkboxes are set to false (unchecked).\nconst selectedRoleValues = { 1: false, 2: false, 3: false }; const [selectedRoles, setSelectedRoles] = useState\u0026lt;{[index: number]: boolean}\u0026gt;(selectedRoleValues); Handling Checkbox Changes The onSelectedRoleChange function is a handler that toggles the checked state of a checkbox when it is clicked. It updates the state by flipping the boolean value of the corresponding role ID.\nconst onSelectedRoleChange = (roleId: number) =\u0026gt; { setSelectedRoles({...selectedRoles, ...{[roleId]: !selectedRoles[roleId]}}); } Fetching Initial Data The useEffect hook is used to fetch the initial roles from the server when the component mounts. It updates the state with the roles fetched for the user, allowing the component to reflect the existing data.\nuseEffect(() =\u0026gt; { let ignoreFetchedUserData = false; if (!route.id) { return; } dispatch(fetchUser(Number.parseInt(route.id, 10))) .unwrap() .then((response) =\u0026gt; { if (!ignoreFetchedUserData) { const roles: {[index: number]: boolean}[] = response.roles; const selectedRolesFromServer = Object.assign({}, ...roles.map(role =\u0026gt; ({ [role.id]: true }))); setSelectedRoles({...selectedRoles, ...selectedRolesFromServer}); } }) .catch(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Error fetching user\u0026#34;); }); return () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Clearing Use effect\u0026#34;); ignoreFetchedUserData = true; }; }, [route, dispatch]); Rendering Checkboxes Finally, the component renders a list of checkboxes based on the availableRoles array. Each checkbox is controlled by the state, and clicking a checkbox triggers the onSelectedRoleChange handler.\nreturn ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; { availableRoles.map((role) =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;label key={role.id}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;checkbox\u0026#34; checked={selectedRoles[role.id]} onChange={() =\u0026gt; { onSelectedRoleChange(role.id); }} /\u0026gt;{\u0026#34; \u0026#34;} {role.name} \u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; ); }) } \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); Conclusion By following the steps outlined above, you can create a dynamic multi-checkbox system in React.js that seamlessly handles user interactions and updates based on external data. This approach ensures that your component is both user-friendly and robust, capable of reflecting the current state of user roles accurately.\nFeel free to extend this example by adding more features, such as saving the selected roles back to the server or adding additional input validation.

Laravel 11 provides a powerful mechanism to handle authorization through Gates and Policies. This post will guide you through the process of using Gates and Policies to secure your application data within a controller, using a Post model as an example.\nWhat are Gates and Policies? Gates and Policies are two complementary features in Laravel that help in authorizing actions. Gates provide a simple closure-based approach to authorization, whereas Policies are dedicated classes that group authorization logic for a specific model or resource.\nDefining a Policy In Laravel, a Policy is a class that contains authorization logic for a particular model. Let\u0026rsquo;s define a PostPolicy to manage authorization for viewing, updating, and deleting posts.\nPostPolicy.php\n\u0026lt;?php namespace App\\Policies; use App\\Models\\Post; use App\\Models\\User; class PostPolicy { /** * Determine whether the user can view the model. */ public function view(User $user, Post $post): bool { return $user-\u0026gt;isAdmin() || $user-\u0026gt;isEditor() || $post-\u0026gt;author_id == $user-\u0026gt;id; } /** * Determine whether the user can update the model. */ public function update(User $user, Post $post): bool { return $user-\u0026gt;isAdmin() || $user-\u0026gt;isEditor() || $post-\u0026gt;author_id === $user-\u0026gt;id; } /** * Determine whether the user can delete the model. */ public function delete(User $user, Post $post): bool { return $user-\u0026gt;isAdmin() || $user-\u0026gt;isEditor() || $post-\u0026gt;author_id === $user-\u0026gt;id; } } In this PostPolicy class, the methods view, update, and delete determine if a user can perform these actions based on their role (admin or editor) or if they are the author of the post.\nApplying Policies in a Controller To use these policies in your controller, you will leverage the Gate::authorize method. This method checks the authorization and throws an exception if the user is not authorized.\nPostController.php\n\u0026lt;?php namespace App\\Http\\Controllers; use App\\Models\\Post; use Illuminate\\Http\\Request; use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Gate; use InvalidArgumentException; class PostsController extends Controller { public function find(int $postId) { $post = Post::find($postId); Gate::authorize(\u0026#39;view\u0026#39;, $post); return response()-\u0026gt;json($post); } public function update(Request $request, int $postId) { $data = $request-\u0026gt;only([\u0026#39;title\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;body\u0026#39;]); $post = Post::with(\u0026#39;author\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;find($postId); Gate::authorize(\u0026#39;update\u0026#39;, $post); $post-\u0026gt;update($data); return response()-\u0026gt;json($post); } public function delete(int $postId) { $post = Post::find($postId); Gate::authorize(\u0026#39;delete\u0026#39;, $post); $deleted = $post-\u0026gt;delete(); if (!$deleted) { throw new InvalidArgumentException(\u0026#39;Could Not Delete Post\u0026#39;); } return response()-\u0026gt;json(); } } In this PostsController class:\nThe find method retrieves a post and authorizes the \u0026lsquo;view\u0026rsquo; action. The update method updates a post after authorizing the \u0026lsquo;update\u0026rsquo; action. The delete method deletes a post after authorizing the \u0026lsquo;delete\u0026rsquo; action. If the current user is not authorized to perform the action, Gate::authorize will throw an AuthorizationException, effectively preventing unauthorized access.\nManually Handling Authorization Failures While Gate::authorize is convenient, it throws an exception when the check fails, but there are scenarios where you might want to manually handle the failure of an authorization check. For example, you might want to return a custom error message or perform some other action.\nManual Authorization Check Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can manually handle authorization failures in a controller method:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace App\\Http\\Controllers; use App\\Models\\Post; use Illuminate\\Http\\Request; use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Gate; use InvalidArgumentException; class PostsController extends Controller { public function create(Request $request) { if ($request-\u0026gt;user()-\u0026gt;cannot(\u0026#39;create\u0026#39;, Post::class)) { abort(403, \u0026#39;You are not authorized to create a post\u0026#39;); } // Proceed with post creation $data = $request-\u0026gt;only([\u0026#39;title\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;body\u0026#39;]); $post = Post::create($data); return response()-\u0026gt;json($post); } // Other methods (find, update, delete)... } In this create method, we manually check if the user has permission to create a post using $request-\u0026gt;user()-\u0026gt;cannot('create', Post::class). If the user is not authorized, we use abort(403, \u0026lsquo;You are not authorized to create a post\u0026rsquo;) to return a 403 Forbidden response with a custom message.\nDefining Gates Gates can be defined in the AuthServiceProvider or anywhere in your application bootstrapping process. Here’s how to define gates using both closure and policy methods.\nClosure-Based Gates You can define a gate using a closure in the AuthServiceProvider:\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Gate; use App\\Models\\Post; use App\\Models\\User; /** * Register any authentication / authorization services. * * @return void */ public function boot() { $this-\u0026gt;registerPolicies(); Gate::define(\u0026#39;update\u0026#39;, function (User $user, Post $post) { return $user-\u0026gt;id === $post-\u0026gt;author_id; }); } This gate checks if the user’s ID matches the author ID of the post.\nPolicy-Based Gates You can also define a gate to use a specific method from a policy:\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Gate; use App\\Policies\\PostPolicy; /** * Register any authentication / authorization services. * * @return void */ public function boot() { $this-\u0026gt;registerPolicies(); Gate::define(\u0026#39;update\u0026#39;, [PostPolicy::class, \u0026#39;update\u0026#39;]); } This gate uses the update method from the PostPolicy class to perform the authorization check.\nWe have attached the PostPolicy as a handler for the PostModel, but if we created a policy class using a convention of [ModelName][Policy], this definition would not be necessary if the gate name update and policy method handler update are the same.\nThis is because using the convention to name your policy Laravel will discover the policy and link it to the model used in the name automatically, given that it is in the policies folder. However, if for example in this example above we wanted to not use the covention and use a policy class like DraftPostPolicy and our post model is called Post, then Laravel will not pick it up automatically, that is when the code snippet above is neccessary, so instead we\u0026rsquo;d do something like:\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Gate; use App\\Policies\\DraftPostPolicy; /** * Register any authentication / authorization services. * * @return void */ public function boot() { $this-\u0026gt;registerPolicies(); Gate::define(\u0026#39;update\u0026#39;, [DraftPostPolicy::class, \u0026#39;update\u0026#39;]); } Using Gates at the Route Level Laravel also allows you to apply gates directly in route definitions using middlewares. This approach is helpful for simple authorization checks that can be defined directly within your route declarations.\nMiddleware-Based Authorization in Routes You can use the can middleware to check authorizations at the route level:\nuse App\\Models\\Post; Route::put(\u0026#39;/post/{post}\u0026#39;, function (Post $post) { // The current user may update the post... })-\u0026gt;middleware(\u0026#39;can:update,post\u0026#39;); Route::post(\u0026#39;/post\u0026#39;, function () { // The current user may create posts... })-\u0026gt;middleware(\u0026#39;can:create,App\\Models\\Post\u0026#39;); In these examples:\nThe PUT /post/{post} route uses the can:update,post middleware to ensure the user can update the specified post. The POST /post route uses the can:create,App\\Models\\Post middleware to ensure the user can create a new post. Route Method Authorization You can also use the can method directly in your route definition:\nuse App\\Models\\Post; Route::post(\u0026#39;/post\u0026#39;, function () { // The current user may create posts... })-\u0026gt;can(\u0026#39;create\u0026#39;, Post::class); This example checks if the current user can create a post before executing the route\u0026rsquo;s closure.\nUsing Gates at the Blade Template Level Laravel\u0026rsquo;s Blade templating engine makes it easy to include authorization checks directly in your views. You can use the @can, @cannot, @elsecan, and @else directives to conditionally display content based on the user\u0026rsquo;s permissions.\nBlade Example Here’s how you can use Gates at the Blade template level:\n@can(\u0026#39;update\u0026#39;, $post) \u0026lt;!-- The current user can update the post... --\u0026gt; @endcan @can(\u0026#39;create\u0026#39;, App\\Models\\Post::class) \u0026lt;!-- The current user can create new posts... --\u0026gt; @endcan @cannot(\u0026#39;delete\u0026#39;, $post) \u0026lt;!-- The current user cannot delete this post... --\u0026gt; @endcannot @elsecan(\u0026#39;create\u0026#39;, App\\Models\\Post::class) \u0026lt;!-- The current user can create new posts... --\u0026gt; @else \u0026lt;!-- The current user cannot update or create posts... --\u0026gt; @endcan In this example:\n@can('update', $post) checks if the current user can update the given post. @can('create', App\\Models\\Post::class) checks if the current user can create a new post. @cannot('delete', $post) checks if the current user cannot delete the given post. @elsecan('create', App\\Models\\Post::class) provides an alternative block if the user can create a post but not update or delete. @else is used as a fallback for users who do not meet any specified conditions. Registering Policies To ensure Laravel knows about your policies, you need to register them in the AuthServiceProvider.\nAuthServiceProvider.php\n\u0026lt;?php namespace App\\Providers; use App\\Models\\Post; use App\\Policies\\PostPolicy; use Illuminate\\Foundation\\Support\\Providers\\AuthServiceProvider as ServiceProvider; class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider { /** * The policy mappings for the application. * * @var array */ protected $policies = [ Post::class =\u0026gt; PostPolicy::class, ]; /** * Register any authentication / authorization services. * * @return void */ public function boot() { $this-\u0026gt;registerPolicies(); } } Here, we map the Post model to the PostPolicy class.\nWe have attached the PostPolicy as a handler for the Post Model, but if we created a policy class using a convention of [ModelName][Policy], this definition in the AuthServiceProvider would not be necessary as laravel will discover it automatically, given that it is in the policies folder. However, if for example in this example above we wanted to not use the covention and use a policy class like DraftPostPolicy and our post model is called Post, then Laravel will not pick it up automatically, that is when the code snippet above is neccessary, so instead we\u0026rsquo;d do something like:\nprotected $policies = [ Post::class =\u0026gt; DraftPostPolicy::class, ]; Conclusion By using Laravel 11\u0026rsquo;s Gates and Policies, you can implement robust security measures in your application. Policies allow you to encapsulate authorization logic in dedicated classes, keeping your controllers clean and focused. The Gate::authorize method ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions, throwing exceptions for unauthorized attempts. Additionally, manually handling authorization failures provides flexibility to customize responses and actions based on your application\u0026rsquo;s needs. Defining gates in the AuthServiceProvider allows you to centralize and manage your authorization logic effectively.\nApplying authorization at the route level using middleware and the can method ensures a clean and declarative approach to securing your routes.

Redux Toolkit simplifies this process by providing a set of tools and best practices. This guide will walk you through setting up Redux Toolkit in a React application, understanding its key components, and effectively using it to manage your app\u0026rsquo;s state.\nStep 1: Setting Up Redux Toolkit npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux Configuring the Store In your project, create a file named store.ts for setting up the Redux store and reducers.\nstore.ts\nimport { combineReducers } from \u0026#34;redux\u0026#34;; import postSlice from \u0026#34;./slices/postSlice\u0026#34;; import userSlice from \u0026#34;./slices/userSlice\u0026#34;; import { configureStore } from \u0026#34;@reduxjs/toolkit\u0026#34;; import { useDispatch, useSelector, useStore } from \u0026#34;react-redux\u0026#34;; // Combine your slice reducers const rootReducer = combineReducers({ post: postSlice, user: userSlice, // We wont implement this slice, but leaving here to show that multiple reducers can be combined this way }); // Configure the store export const store = configureStore({ reducer: rootReducer, }); // Define types for RootState, AppDispatch, and AppStore export type RootState = ReturnType\u0026lt;typeof store.getState\u0026gt;; export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch; export type AppStore = typeof store; // Custom hooks to use throughout your app export const useAppDispatch = useDispatch.withTypes\u0026lt;AppDispatch\u0026gt;(); export const useAppSelector = useSelector.withTypes\u0026lt;RootState\u0026gt;(); export const useAppStore = useStore.withTypes\u0026lt;AppStore\u0026gt;(); In this setup, combineReducers is used to combine postSlice and userSlice reducers into a single root reducer. The configureStore function from Redux Toolkit is then used to create the store.\nStep 2: Creating Slices Slices in Redux Toolkit combine the reducer logic and actions into a single file. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a postSlice to manage the state of posts in your application.\nslices/postSlice.ts\nimport { createAsyncThunk, createSlice } from \u0026#34;@reduxjs/toolkit\u0026#34;; import axios from \u0026#34;axios\u0026#34;; import { Post } from \u0026#34;../types\u0026#34;; // Assuming you have a Post type defined // Async thunk for fetching posts export const fetchPosts = createAsyncThunk\u0026lt;Post[], void\u0026gt;( \u0026#34;post/fetchPosts\u0026#34;, async () =\u0026gt; { try { const response = await axios.get(\u0026#34;http://localhost:8000/api/posts\u0026#34;); return response.data; } catch (error) { throw new Error(\u0026#34;Failed to get posts data\u0026#34;); } } ); // Initial state const initialState = { posts: [], loading: false, error: null, }; // Create the post slice const postSlice = createSlice({ name: \u0026#34;post\u0026#34;, initialState, reducers: {}, extraReducers: (builder) =\u0026gt; { builder .addCase(fetchPosts.pending, (state) =\u0026gt; { state.loading = true; state.error = null; }) .addCase(fetchPosts.fulfilled, (state, action) =\u0026gt; { state.loading = false; state.posts = action.payload; }) .addCase(fetchPosts.rejected, (state, action) =\u0026gt; { state.loading = false; state.error = action.error.message || \u0026#34;Failed to load posts\u0026#34;; }); }, }); export default postSlice.reducer; Here, createAsyncThunk is used to handle asynchronous actions. This function helps to manage different states like pending, fulfilled, and rejected. The slice manages the state changes in response to these actions.\nStep 3: Integrating Redux Store with React To use the Redux store in your React app, wrap your root component with the Provider component from react-redux.\nApp.tsx\nimport React from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; import { Provider } from \u0026#34;react-redux\u0026#34;; import { store } from \u0026#34;./store.ts\u0026#34;; import YourComponent from \u0026#34;./YourComponent\u0026#34;; // Import your main component const App: React.FC = () =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;Provider store={store}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;YourComponent /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Provider\u0026gt; ); }; export default App; Wrapping your application with the Provider component makes the Redux store available to all components in your app.\nStep 4: Using Custom Hooks for State and Dispatch To interact with the Redux store, use the custom hooks useAppDispatch and useAppSelector that you defined in store.ts.\nExample Usage in a Component\nimport React, { useEffect } from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; import { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from \u0026#34;./store\u0026#34;; import { fetchPosts } from \u0026#34;./slices/postSlice\u0026#34;; const PostList: React.FC = () =\u0026gt; { const dispatch = useAppDispatch(); const { posts, loading, error } = useAppSelector((state) =\u0026gt; state.post); useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { dispatch(fetchPosts()); }, [dispatch]); if (loading) { return \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;Loading...\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;; } if (error) { return \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;Error: {error}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;; } return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; {posts.map((post) =\u0026gt; ( \u0026lt;li key={post.id}\u0026gt;{post.title}\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; ))} \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); }; export default PostList; In this component, useAppDispatch is used to dispatch the fetchPosts action, and useAppSelector is used to select the post state from the Redux store.\nConclusion By following these steps, you can set up Redux Toolkit in your React application to manage your state efficiently. Redux Toolkit streamlines the process of writing Redux logic, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.

This ensures that any ongoing asynchronous operation does not attempt to update the state if the component is no longer mounted or if the dependencies have changed.\nConclusion Using a flag to track whether the component is still mounted before updating the state within an asynchronous operation ensures that state updates are only attempted when the component is active.

We will be using typescript on the react.js frontned, along with react redux toolkit, but do not worry as youc an follow along even if you only know javascript. React redux toolkit helps with state management. It might be overkill for a simple login registration app like this, but makes life very easy once the app codebase grows. Users will be able to register using an email as their username and password. After successful registration, they shall be able to login. We wil demonstrate the login mechanism by having a userpforile area/route in the frontend of the application which will be locked and only accessible to logged in. The frontend and backend will be on different domains, so the after logging in, we will provide the user with a token, which will be stored in localstorage of the browser. This will be send along in the header each request which requires authentication to get data back from the server. We will also need to setup cors so that our frontend domain can send requests to the backend domanin app.\nProject Structure Firstly, please clone the starter repositories here, one for the laravel backend and one for the react frontend. Put each of them in a separate folder. We already have all tthe required libraries added on the frontend inside package.json as listed below.\n- react-dom\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^18.2.0\u0026#34;, - \u0026#34;@reduxjs/toolkit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^2.2.1\u0026#34;, - \u0026#34;axios\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^1.6.7\u0026#34;, - \u0026#34;react-redux\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^9.1.0\u0026#34;, - \u0026#34;react-router-dom\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^6.22.3\u0026#34;, - \u0026#34;redux\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^5.0.1\u0026#34; I used vite to create the frontend project and composer to create the backend project in two seperate folders. An alternative would have been to host the react project directly inside the laravel project folder, hence having one domain for both frontend and backend, but we won;t be doibg that in this tutorial. Possibly, we may do it in another blog post.\nFrontend In the terminal, move inside the frontend folder using cd your-frontend-folder and run npm install. After successfully installing the libraries, run npm run dev to start the frontend server.

state.error = action.error.message || \u0026#34;Failed to update user\u0026#34;; }); }, }); export default authSlice.reducer; Then create the corresponding service file, src/services/userService.ts:\nimport axios from \u0026#34;axios\u0026#34;; import { UpdateUserData } from \u0026#34;../store/slices/userReducer\u0026#34;; import authHeader from \u0026#34;./authHeader\u0026#34;; export const makeGetUserRequest = async () =\u0026gt; { try { const headers = {headers: authHeader.getAuthHeader()};

} }; Finally, create a file in src/services/authHeader.ts, where we shall have the logic for storing and retreving user token. The token gets stored after user login and gets retrieved and sent along with requests which need authetication.\nimport { USER_TOKEN_KEY } from \u0026#34;./authService\u0026#34;; const authHeader = { accessToken: \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, initializeToken: (accessToken: string) =\u0026gt; { authHeader.accessToken = accessToken; }, getAuthHeader: () =\u0026gt; { if (!authHeader.accessToken) { const token = localStorage.getItem(USER_TOKEN_KEY); if (token) { authHeader.initializeToken(token); } } if (authHeader.accessToken) { return {Authorization: \u0026#39;Bearer \u0026#39; + authHeader.accessToken}; } else { return {}; } }, }; export default authHeader; Let\u0026rsquo;s setup the redux react toolkit reducers which will combine and setup the slices above. Create a file in src/store/index.ts\nimport { combineReducers, configureStore } from \u0026#34;@reduxjs/toolkit\u0026#34;; import authReducer from \u0026#34;./slices/authReducer\u0026#34;; import userReducer from \u0026#34;./slices/userReducer\u0026#34;; import { useDispatch, useSelector, useStore } from \u0026#34;react-redux\u0026#34;; const rootReducer = combineReducers({ auth: authReducer, user: userReducer, }); export const store = configureStore({ reducer: rootReducer, }); export type RootState = ReturnType\u0026lt;typeof store.getState\u0026gt;; export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch; export type AppStore = typeof store; export const useAppDispatch = useDispatch.withTypes\u0026lt;AppDispatch\u0026gt;(); export const useAppSelector = useSelector.withTypes\u0026lt;RootState\u0026gt;(); export const useAppStore = useStore.withTypes\u0026lt;AppStore\u0026gt;(); In the above, we are combining userSlice reducer and authSlice reducer into one which will be used to initialise the store. The line after useAppDispatch, useAppSelector and useAppStore are just some syntactic sugar setups so that typescript can easily recognize our entities. In short, useAppDIspatch is to be used in place of useDispatch, useAppSelector in place of useSelector and useAppStore in place of useStore. If we did not set that up, we would have to repeat a lot of code whenever we want to use those if we wanted to get code typescript hinting.\nLets look inside of App.tsx, modify it like below by adding the store to the main App component\nImport our store and Provider at the top:\nimport { Provider } from \u0026#34;react-redux\u0026#34;; import { store } from \u0026#34;./store\u0026#34;; Then wrap the remaining code inside the Provider like below:\n\u0026lt;Provider store={store}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;BrowserRouter\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Link to={\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;}\u0026gt;Login\u0026lt;/Link\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Link to={\u0026#34;register\u0026#34;}\u0026gt;Register\u0026lt;/Link\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Link to={\u0026#34;profile\u0026#34;}\u0026gt;Profile\u0026lt;/Link\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Routes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34; element={\u0026lt;LoginComponent /\u0026gt;} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/login\u0026#34; element={\u0026lt;LoginComponent /\u0026gt;} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/register\u0026#34; element={\u0026lt;RegisterComponent /\u0026gt;} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/profile\u0026#34; element={\u0026lt;UserProfileComponent /\u0026gt;} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Routes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/BrowserRouter\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Provider\u0026gt; Backend Install backend composer packages, setup database environment, user model and setup cors In the terminal run cd backend-folder and run composer install\nThen install the Sanctum package using php artisan install:api. This adds a new package, \u0026quot;laravel/sanctum\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;^4.0\u0026quot;, in composer.json inside the require key.\nAnswer no when asked if you want to run the database migration. Inside the user model app/Models/User.php, add the trait Laravel\\Sanctum\\HasApiTokens:\nThis package is used to issue user tokens upon login and is used to protect routes which need authentication to access.\nAfter installing sanctum, run php artisan config:publish cors to publish the cors.php config file, which will create a new file in config/cors.php.\nCreate a file inside the same backend folder .env and modify the follwing variables:\nDB_HOST=127.0.0.1 DB_PORT=3306 DB_DATABASE=name-of-database DB_USERNAME=database-server-username DB_PASSWORD=database-server-password Make sure you have mysql installed, running. Also enure the database set in the variable DB_DATABASE has been created.\nAt the tip of the model import the class :\nuse Laravel\\Sanctum\\HasApiTokens; and use it as seen below:\nuse HasFactory, HasApiTokens, Notifiable; Modify the $fillable property and add these two columns so we can update those as well:\n\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;address\u0026#39;, Create Routes and Controllers for login and registration Inside the file routes/api.php add the following routes at the end:\nRoute::post(\u0026#39;/login\u0026#39;, [AuthController::class, \u0026#39;login\u0026#39;]); Route::post(\u0026#39;/register\u0026#39;, [AuthController::class, \u0026#39;register\u0026#39;]); and import the AuthController use App\\Http\\Controllers\\AuthController;\nNow create the AuthController in app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php with the content:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace App\\Http\\Controllers; use Illuminate\\Http\\Request; use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Auth; use App\\Models\\User; use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Hash; class AuthController extends Controller { public function login(Request $request) { $credentials = $request-\u0026gt;only(\u0026#39;email\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;password\u0026#39;); if (Auth::attempt($credentials)) { $user = Auth::user(); $token = $user-\u0026gt;createToken(\u0026#39;auth_token\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;plainTextToken; return response()-\u0026gt;json($token); } return response()-\u0026gt;json([\u0026#39;message\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Unauthorized\u0026#39;], 401); } public function register(Request $request) { $request-\u0026gt;validate([ \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;required|string|max:255\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;email\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;required|string|email|max:255|unique:users\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;password\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;required|string|min:8\u0026#39;, ]); $user = User::create([ \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $request-\u0026gt;name, \u0026#39;email\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $request-\u0026gt;email, \u0026#39;password\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Hash::make($request-\u0026gt;password), ]); return response()-\u0026gt;json([\u0026#39;message\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;User registered successfully\u0026#39;], 201); } } Create Routes and Controllers for updating and getting user data Add these routes to routes/api.php:\nRoute::middleware(\u0026#39;auth:sanctum\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;group(function () { Route::get(\u0026#39;getUserData\u0026#39;, [UserProfileController::class, \u0026#39;user\u0026#39;]); Route::post(\u0026#39;updateUserProfile\u0026#39;, [UserProfileController::class, \u0026#39;updateProfile\u0026#39;]); }); This line Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')-\u0026gt;group(function () { is meant to add a protection middleware group so that the routes are only accessibly by a logged in user who provides a valid token. This is made possible by the sanctum package we just installed.\nImport the controller at the top use App\\Http\\Controllers\\UserProfileController;:\nAdd a controller file in app/Http/Controllers/UserProfileController.php with the content:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace App\\Http\\Controllers; use Illuminate\\Http\\Request; use Illuminate\\Http\\Response; use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Auth; class UserProfileController extends Controller { public function updateProfile(Request $request) { $request-\u0026gt;validate([ \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;required|string|max:255\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;phone\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [\u0026#39;required\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;string\u0026#39;], \u0026#39;address\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [\u0026#39;required\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;string\u0026#39;], ]); $userData = [ \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $request-\u0026gt;input(\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;phone\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $request-\u0026gt;input(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;address\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $request-\u0026gt;input(\u0026#39;address\u0026#39;) ]; $user = Auth::user(); $updated = $user-\u0026gt;update($userData); if (!$updated) { return response(\u0026#39;Could not update profile\u0026#39;, Response::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST); } return response($user-\u0026gt;only(\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;address\u0026#39;), 200); } public function user() { if (Auth::check()) { $user = Auth::user(); return response($user-\u0026gt;only(\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;address\u0026#39;), 200); } return response()-\u0026gt;json([\u0026#39;message\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Unauthorized\u0026#39;], 401); } } Update user migration file to add extra fields Inside ther migration file 0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php\nAfter the line $table-\u0026gt;string('email')-\u0026gt;unique();\nadd the following:\n$table-\u0026gt;string(\u0026#39;phone\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;nullable(); $table-\u0026gt;text(\u0026#39;address\u0026#39;); In the backend terminal, run php artisan migrate to create the database tables and columns.\nFinally, run php artisan serve to run the laravel php backend server Ensure you have atleast php 8.2 installed on yur local system. To verify that the backend is running, visit http://localhost:8000/ in your browser and yu shall see some beautiful UI with some links made by laravel authors.\nUpdate login, register and userprofile components Lets move into the RegisterComponent.tsx and modify it as below:\nimport React, { useState } from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; import \u0026#34;./RegisterComponent.css\u0026#34;; import { registerUser } from \u0026#34;../store/slices/authReducer\u0026#34;; import { useNavigate } from \u0026#34;react-router-dom\u0026#34;; import { useAppDispatch } from \u0026#34;../store\u0026#34;; const RegisterComponent = () =\u0026gt; { const [name, setName] = useState(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); const [email, setEmail] = useState(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); const [password, setPassword] = useState(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); const dispatch = useAppDispatch(); const naivgate = useNavigate(); const handleSubmit = (event: React.FormEvent\u0026lt;HTMLFormElement\u0026gt;) =\u0026gt; { event.preventDefault(); dispatch(registerUser({ name, email, password })) .unwrap() .then(() =\u0026gt; { naivgate(\u0026#34;/login\u0026#34;); }) .catch((response) =\u0026gt; { alert(`Error occured ${response.message}`); }); }; const onPropertyChage = ( callback: typeof setName | typeof setEmail | typeof setPassword ) =\u0026gt; { return (event: React.ChangeEvent\u0026lt;HTMLInputElement\u0026gt;): void =\u0026gt; { callback(event.target.value); }; }; return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Register\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className=\u0026#34;register-form\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label htmlFor=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input onChange={onPropertyChage(setName)} type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label htmlFor=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input onChange={onPropertyChage(setEmail)} type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label htmlFor=\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input onChange={onPropertyChage(setPassword)} type=\u0026#34;password\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;password\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;password\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button\u0026gt;Register\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); }; export default RegisterComponent; What\u0026rsquo;s changed is that we added handlers for when the form is sbmitted a nd when the user changes the input fields, we update the corresponding local component states.

One such language for me is the c-sharp language. One of the primary reasons why I love the language is a really cool feature called Linq.\nI simply cannot emphasize the amount of time this feature has saved me while doing work. It integrates seamlessly into my workflow and find myself almost subconsciously using it. And did I say super awesome chaining you could do as well just like in jquery.\nTalking of jquery, as of late, most of my work has been involved with javascript and json and such stuff. I find myself missing this really cool linq feature. I had to write a lot of my own custom extension methods to manipulate arrays and json objects. If you are in the same boat as me, you might find the following examples very useful. Some examples of linq features you can find substitutes for in javascript are below.\nThe underscore “_” is a global variable which is available to you after including the underscore.js script in you application.\nIf you have a javascript array for example, myArray, you can do the following operations on it using underscore.\n1. Looping through array elements _.each(myArray, functionToRun)\nwhere the custom function “functionToRun” is a function which you have written an implementation for and it is passed a single item in the array during each iteration\n2. Filter array elemnts based on a “where” criteria( familiar, linq people?) _.where(myArray, properties)\nIn this case, the variable properties is a key value object which is used to filter the array “myArray”\nFor example if you have an array in the format :\nvar myArray = [{ name : \u0026ldquo;Bob\u0026rdquo; }, { name : \u0026ldquo;Alex\u0026rdquo; }, { name : \u0026ldquo;Bob\u0026rdquo; } ]\npassing the array above with the following filter property :\nvar properties = { name : \u0026ldquo;Alex\u0026rdquo; }\nwould filter through the array and return a single item which matches the criteria specified in the “properties” variable. In this case the value returned is an array with the object having a name of “Alex” as shown below :\n[{ name : \u0026ldquo;Alex\u0026rdquo; }]\n3. Get first item from an array Using the following method passing your array as the first argument would return you the first item of the array\n_.first(myArray)\n4. Taking the first n items from an array Using the same method above but this time passing an optional number as a second argument will return you the first n items in the array\n_.first(array, n)\nMy C-sharp buddies are probably thinking of the Take method right now.\nWhile c-sharp developers coming from the .net world will be familiar with the examples above, it will also be useful for those who were primarily developing in javascript and need some extra firepower with object manipulation.\nIf you need reference and want to find some more useful features like the one I just showcased above, you can head over to the official Underscore Js website at http://underscorejs.org/\nThat’s it for now.

You might be asking, what does this mean? Good question.\nI am confident that you know what a domain is. If not, then have a quick look here at the wikipedia article. Ok, so lets say you have a domain named http://www.mydomain.com.\nAnd you have an application hosted on that domain. By default that application would be using port 80 of the domain like so : http://www.mydomain.com:80 .\nIf you happen to have another (server side) part of the application hosted on another domain like http://www.myotherdomain.com . When your client side part of the application tries to connect to the server side using any of the four CRUD ( create, read, update and delete) through ajax.\nMost modern browsers, because of security reasons, would not let that operation happen. You would be greeted by a Cross Origin Resource Sharing error if you try to do such a connetion.\nWhat this error means is, the server would not let your client side application access any resource in server side application. Now you may be clever and be like “hey!”, what if I put both client and server side on the same domain?\nYes, pretty clever but unless both client and server side share the same port and are on the same domain. The application considers the two sides to be on different domains (i.e. considers http://www.mydomain.com:80 and http://www.mydomain.com:90 to be two different domains) and would still throw the CORS error we encountered earlier on.\nDont be alarmed too much though because there is a solution which I am about to share with you. This is one trick I discovered while working on my chat application( which is still in progress ) whose client and server side are hosted in a similar manner (on the same domain but on different ports).\nThere are two steps involved in this solution You would need to make you client side add an http header to it request so as to let the server know from what domain( including the port) the request is originating from. This is done adding a header with a key value pair of ORIGIN and domainname respectively as so : Origin: http://www.example-client.com: 68\nassuming port 68 is the port on which your client app is hosted on\nNow you have to make a change in you server side application so it allows requestes from foreign domains. How you do that is to add an http header with a key value pair of “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” and “domain-to-be-allowed-to-make-requests” respectively to any response it sends for any foreign domain requests, like so : Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example-client.com:100\nThis way when the server receives a request with the ORIGIN header. If that matches any of the allowed domains in it response, then the two applications are able to communicate.\nWhew!, that was a tough one but hopefully now that won’t be an issue for you any more. That’s it for now and as usual, please let us know in the comments if you have anything else to add or if you have any questions.

Yes, literally, “boy” was the nickname he gave me for some reason. He said “you will never be satisfied if you always want to keep up with the latest and greatest gadgets”. He also said that sometimes its ok to be behind schedule a little bit. You see, my thought as a young, gadget addicted teenager was that. “This was some excuse he’d come up with just to have some breathing space from getting me the latest video games”. How naive I was though.\nLooking back Looking back from now, I can translate his words to match my current “hubby” and joint profession, which is software development. When I just started out about 5 years ago, I was very enthusiastic with just about every new technology I came across in my field. I dabbled into a whole bunch of “stuff” ranging from java, python, c, php, c sharp e.t.c.\nFrustration, having to change strategy Few years down the road, frustration started creeping in. Not because of my lack of ability in comprehending the technologies. But because it was near impossible in keeping up with technology and its rapid pace. Going like this for a while, I quickly realized I had used most of the time to keep up instead of digging into some specifics. I had to quickly change my strategy if I was to stay sane among all this craziness.\nObviously, one should have known this I can guess what some of you may be thinking. That this realization should have been obvious. That one should know this. But let me tell you it isn’t so. It can be very easy for you to become so engrossed in this technology world that you sometime sacrifise quality for quantity because lets face it, the technology world just keeps getting more and more fascinating as the years move by.\nSensible persona kicking in Now with this realization I had narrowed down my niche a little bit more. Not to say that I would soon start calling mself a “c sharp” developer or a “php” programmer because thats just plain silly. But I would narrow down my focus, and I would advice you to follow suit if you are starting out, because believe, me I came to realize the hard way that there were sone hidden truths behind my dad’s words.\nDont get it wrong, understand it This may seem like a contradiction to a previous post I wrote earlier on about how learning a new programming language can help you become a better programmer. But if you look closely, you may come to realize that its more of a question of how much is enough? If you only know one language, say php, yes maybe knowing java later will be of use in teaching you good practise. On the other hand though if you know c, python and ruby, you probably may not gain much from learning a language like java.\nConclusion So its mostly a judgement call and whichever you decide to make, I wish you the best of luck in your fabolous career.

You see, my thought as a young, gadget addicted teenager was that. “This was some excuse he’d come up with just to have some breathing space from getting me the latest video games”.","tags":[],"title":"Staying Sane among all the craziness (keeping up with technology)"},{"categories":["Self Improvement"],"contents":"My Theory I came into first year at the University of Manchester, with a fair knowledge of programming in Java. I was fully aware that there were people out there who were well versed in other languages and using it to solve real life problems. Even with this knowledge, I did not even bother to look into any other because I hadn’t yet known the importance of learning a new programming language. I was under the impression that Java was all I needed to know. That if I knew it well enough, it could easily solve any problem I wanted to.\nFirst Year Project Few weeks into my studies, a few colleagues of mine and I had to do start a group project. It was a website about helping local footballers connect with local clubs. This was the first real task which put my initial theory to test. Remember, I was under the impression that Java was all I needed. At first thought, I was thinking, hmm, no problems, we could do it in Java because we all knew that. But for some reason, we were advised by my first year tutor to use a different language to the one we already knew. He told us to look into Php, and specifically a framework called Cake Php.\nChristmas Time research At around Christmas time we all started researching about Php. Remember, most if not all of us had no knowledge of php. Even worse, we were to learn a framework on top of that. I remember going to the Netbeans website and diving into every piece of Php tutorial I could find there. This was not easy but I knew I had to learn it eventually.\nAfter Christmas In our second semester, we all met several times to discuss our project. After a while of doing this, our website was still nowhere near complete. We had gone a decent way though, we had a site up and running but there were still loads to be done. We really tried hard doing all the research we could, send links here and there to each other. Around march, we had to showcase our project result for marking. We did a presentation on what we had done already and also had the chance to explain other plans we had but did not implements yet. To be honest, I think we did well with a mark of 65%, with a very unfinished product.\nLessons learnt After the project, I learnt two very valuable lessons. The lessons were that, one should never use the same tool, in this case programming language, to try to solve every problem. And secondly, one should never be content with what they already know, you should always try to reach out and learn more.\nThese Days As a result of that project, I still keep thinking what could have been, if we knew something else apart from Java. I have become even more motivated to learn more languages. After doing more Php for over a year, i started looking into JavaScript. I did that for a while, the usual jQuery. After a few months, I started getting into .net. I did a bit of c# with Asp.Net Mvc, web forms e.t.c. during the summer of 2012. I must say its the best choice I had made yet in terms of language or platform choice. It even helped me get a placement at an Oil distribution company called Gazprom Energy in Manchester where I did a fair amount of .Net development with web forms and Wcf services . And the best thing of all is, I do not even intend to stop there. Currently, i have seriously started learning the whole html5 stack starting with JavaScript language core. Doing a bit of backbone js, a nice little library with strong emphasis on back-end connection to help me understand the language architecture and design patterns. After that, I plan to learn ruby and for the mean time, I will concentrate on building up on those skills for the future because I think learning a new programming language can help you become a better programmer. That’s all I have for now, I will see you in the next post and thanks for reading. If you have anything interesting to share, please let us know in the comments below. Adiós.\nYou can read up on what one of my colleagues is up to by going to his blog post about his third year project.\n","date":"February 19, 2013","hero":"/images/posts/new-language-different-day.png","permalink":"http://laminsanneh.com/posts/learning-programming-language-programmer/","summary":"My Theory I came into first year at the University of Manchester, with a fair knowledge of programming in Java.

So I decided to share some of what I know now that I’m comfortable with them. This tutorial applies to both Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2012, sorry Visual studio 2008 and Visual studio 2005 folks, I was not programming .Net and or C# back in those days. This is not a What is Visual Studio tutorial, but I have a separate post coming up soon for that if you’re new to it as well. The language does not matter, either C# or Visual Basic will do. We’ll use a new Asp.Net MVC3/4 web application as the example for this post.\nCreate a New Asp.Net Mvc 4 solution Start by creating a new project by going to file new project on the upper left of your Editor. Using VS 2012 with the 2010 blue theme applied\nSolution ‘MvcApplication3’ This is the name of your solution. A solution is like a container for your whole application. In .Net world, it is the global container which contains other projects. A single application can have only one solution but an Mvc 4 solution can contain multiple projects. An example of a project is described below after the image showing a newly created solution. Visual studio project structure fresh\nMvcApplication3 – A Project Name This is the name for a single project. It is contained in the solution we just described above. In this project we have direct children folders and or files. The children we would now briefly describe below.\nProperties This is where we have information related to our project which helps in uniquely identifying it. It is sort of like a meta file for our project.\nReferences In here we have references to other projects in our solution and DLL dependencies which we our project needs to run.\nApp_Data Inside of here is where you can store data related to your website. Most of the time you people use it to store portable file-based databases like an .mdf file for example.\nApp_Start The app start is somewhat of a special folder in that by default it contains various configuration files. Below are the default files in it upon creating a new project. App Start Folder\nContent This is where you would put stylesheets and optionally images for your website.\nControllers Your application controllers live in here. Just Briefly, a controller is like a decision maker for your application or project. Any requests made by an application user gets directed to one of several controller which then decides what to do next, be it fetch data or store it in the database e.t.c.\nModels Your application models reside in here. For example if your application were to represent entities like Person, Car e.t.c., you’d store those classes here.\nScripts In here as I’m sure you guessed it, is where you organise your javascript files.\nViews The view files for you project reside in here. If you’re wondering what a view file is. It is a file containing html and a little bit of c# code for displaying your pages. C# view files end with .cshtml while VB.Net view files end with .vbhtml . Views Folder\nGlobal.asax file In here, you have project wide settings registration. Any configurations you have made in you application are registered or de-registered in this file. For e.g. routes.\nPackages.config file This file is where your referenced packages in references are described. For e.g. version numbers of referenced packages along with their .net targets are detailed in this file.\nWeb.config Inside of the web.config file is where you store other setting which you need to change without recompiling your code. It is an xml file so does not need compilation. You can also store information like connection strings for your databases, membership providers for website authentication e.t.c.\nWeb config file Sneek peek at part of an asp.net mvc 4 web.config file\nYou still have choices Just Remember, asp.net folder structure is mostly for best practice as most of the structure can be over-ridden in favour of your choice of structure. But most of the time I find that I need to only add extra folders but leave the pre existing default one intact as they pretty much do the job that I want in terms of structuring my code. So there we have it, I hope that helps clear up some confusion.
